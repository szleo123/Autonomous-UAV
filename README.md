## Introduction
This project implemented a Geometric Nonlinear Controller for the quadrotor. It built a trajectory generator for the quadrotor with Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and Astar Algorithm and applied minimum jerk polynomial segments to smooth trajectories. The tools I used to estimate the poses of the quadrotor by applying Error State Kalman Filter are onboard sensors such as an inertial measurement unit(IMU) and a stereo pair.
